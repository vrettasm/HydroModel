Welcome to Hydro-Berkeley's documentation!
==========================================
This project implements the Python code of the underground (stochastic)
hydrological model that was developed during my postdoctoral tenure at
the Dept. of Earth & Planetary Science, U. C. Berkeley, (2013 - 2016).

There might be updates in the future, but this first version is now fully
operational. The data (water table depths, precipitation values, etc.) are
not available online and could be accessible only through communication
to Prof. Inez Fung (PI of the project).
