Help
====
This page provides basic help into how to install and run the software.
The information here is accurate for Linux and MacOs operating systems.

Installation
------------
There are two options to install the software.

1. The easiest way is to visit the GitHub web-page of the project:
   https://github.com/vrettasm/HydroModel and download the code in
   zip format. This option doesn't require a prior installation of
   git on the computer.

2. Alternatively one can clone the project directly using git as
   follows: ::

    $ git clone https://github.com/vrettasm/HydroModel.git

How to run
----------
To execute the program, first navigate to the main directory of
the project (i.e. where the berkeley_hydro_main.py is located),
and then run the following command: ::

    $ python3 -O berkeley_hydro_main.py --params ./model_parameters/input_parameters.json

The '-O' option is not necessary, but it could speed up the execution
of the simulation.

.. note::
   This assumes that the 'input_parameters.json' file includes the datafile
   location in the:
   "Data_Filename": "path/to/datafile.csv"
