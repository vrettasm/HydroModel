# HydroModel - Berkeley
Hydrological Model (... work in progress ...)

This project will implement the Python code of the underground (stochastic)
hydrological model that was developed during my postdoctoral tenure at the
University of California - Berkeley. The work is described with details in
two (open access) publications:

1) Michail D. Vrettas and Inez Y. Fung (2015). "Toward a new parameterization
of hydraulic conductivity in climate models: Simulation of rapid groundwater
fluctuations in Northern California".
Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES), vol. (7), issue (4),
pp:2105-2135, https://doi.org/10.1002/2015MS000516.

2) Michail D. Vrettas and Inez Y. Fung (2017). "Sensitivity of transpiration
to subsurface properties: Exploration with a 1-D model".
